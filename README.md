# Jukebox - A Rustic Musical Experience

## Foreword

Jukebox is, as of the time of writing, not yet complete. In fact, this project
is in its infancy. It will likely be some time before this becomes the perfect
replacement for Lavalink, but development will be done publicly so you can tune
in and keep yourself informed. More information will be available later.

Open source is our home.

## So, what is this?

Jukebox is a rustic recreation of [Lavalink], a very popular and well known
music querying and streaming utility within the Discord world. You might ask,
aren't we reinventing the wheel here?

And to that, here is our answer:

### Light as a feather

Java is clunky. Rust isn't. Standalone binaries of Jukebox can be built and
deployed to any platform Rust supports, with much lower resource usage than
the JVM and the ability to run containerized with no external dependencies.

Less work for us, less work for you. You can thank us later.

### Fast as lightning

KCS prides itself on code quality and ensuring everything is as good as
possible. Our philosophy is computer science, not computer industry - you're in
safe hands, and these hands make every effort to produce software that is
trustworthy, sensible, scalable, and efficient. How it should be.
